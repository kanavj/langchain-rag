# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

This is a simple RAG implementation using [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/rag/). I am currently using Groq to generate the responses, however, the plan is to switch to a local model or an OpenAI enterprise model in the final product.
